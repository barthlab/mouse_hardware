new computer hardware:
    raspberry pi zero (does not need to be w)
    add ethernet
        https://www.amazon.com/USB-HUB-HAT-Board-Compatible/dp/B07X1BH5FN/


valves:
    LHD Series 3-Way Control Solenoid Valve
        5 V DC @ ~110 milliAmps
    solder transistors to the valve

    TODO maybe have 2 different valves for gas and water?
        to standardize water
            regulator + fluid dispenser


        pressure measurement:
            Adafruit MPRLS Ported Pressure Sensor Breakout - 0 to 25 PSI (3965)
                so we can measure air/water pressure


lickport:
    mouse's tongue will complete circuit, should be simpler than current situation


power:
    5 V DC wall converter
    12 V DC wall converter








old computer hardware:
    arduino lenoardo
    yun shield
    ??? - the power one


valves:
    LHD Series 3-Way Control Solenoid Valve
        12 V DC @ 65 milliAmps


lickport:
    Adafruit AT42QT1010


power:
    12 V DC wall converter
