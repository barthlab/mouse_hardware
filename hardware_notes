new computer hardware:
    raspberry pi zero w


valves:
    LHD Series 3-Way Control Solenoid Valve
        5 V DC @ ~110 milliAmps
    solder transistor to the valve so we can just use it with the hardware

    TODO maybe have 2 different valves for gas and water?


pressure measurement:
    Adafruit MPRLS Ported Pressure Sensor Breakout - 0 to 25 PSI (3965)
        so we can measure pressure for everything


lickport:
    need to verify if we can sample at a high enough rate to use interrupts for the mouse licks

        AT42QT1010 sends out a heartbeat pulse every once in a while

                C1:
                    22 nF
                    2 - 50 nF
                    decrease it to increase response time


power:
    5 V DC wall converter
    12 V DC wall converter


standardize water:
    if we want to standardize the water pressure, we could use a regulator hooked up to pressurized water?
        and then precisely time the solenoids
        or we could release a very consistent amount of water
