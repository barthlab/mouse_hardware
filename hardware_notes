new computer hardware:
    raspberry pi zero w


valves:
    LHD Series 3-Way Control Solenoid Valve
        5 V DC @ ~110 milliAmps
    solder transistor to the valve so we can just use it with the hardware

    TODO maybe have 2 different valves for gas and water?


pressure measurement:
    Adafruit MPRLS Ported Pressure Sensor Breakout - 0 to 25 PSI (3965)
        so we can measure pressure for everything


lickport:
    we need to use a larger capacitor or a different circuit to be able to sense at the frequency we want (6-10 Hz) bc we can currently see (0-7 Hz)

    TODO look into alternatives that don't require us to solder a new capacitor on


power:
    5 V DC wall converter
    12 V DC wall converter


standardize water:
    if we want to standardize the water pressure, we could use a regulator hooked up to pressurized water?
        and then precisely time the solenoids
        or we could release a very consistent amount of water



old computer hardware:
    arduino lenoardo
    yun shield
    ??? - the power one


valves:
    LHD Series 3-Way Control Solenoid Valve
        12 V DC @ 65 milliAmps


lickport:
    Adafruit AT42QT1010


power:
    12 V DC wall converter
