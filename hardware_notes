new computer hardware:
    raspberry pi zero (does not need to be w)
    add ethernet

valves:
    LHD Series 3-Way Control Solenoid Valve
        5 V DC @ ~110 milliAmps
    solder transistors to the valve

    TODO maybe have 2 different valves for gas and water?
        to standardize water
            regulator + fluid dispenser


        pressure measurement:
            Adafruit MPRLS Ported Pressure Sensor Breakout - 0 to 25 PSI (3965)
                so we can measure air/water pressure


lickport:
    this isn't working and I have no idea why
        this is the top priority for this subproject right now

    need to verify if we can sample at a high enough rate to use interrupts for the mouse licks
